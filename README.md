Description:

Nigeria-Tourist-App is designed to help users find their way and locate luxurious locations around the country. The app comes with a search functionality that returns query matches. When a location is selected, details of the location, link to Wikipedia article on the location, and link to google map is presented to the user.
The app comes with WhatsApp integrated widget that facilitates prompt communication with the website administration. There is also the contact form for leaving electronic mails. The flight booking functionality is what we are looking at solidifying in the future.
