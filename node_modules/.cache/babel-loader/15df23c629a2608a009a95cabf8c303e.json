1990, I did not even know I was joining a fellowship. I was a rather smallish boy from downtown who arrived late to resume. There was no money, so I did not...\n                   <i className=\"bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right\"></i>\n                </p>\n              </div>\n\n          <div className=\"slide\" id=\"prof-saba\">\n            <img src=\"assets/img/testimonials/prof-saba.jpeg\" className=\"testimonial-img\" alt=\"\"/>\n            <h3>Prof A. B. Saba</h3>\n            <h4>Ibadan, Nigeria</h4>\n            <p>\n              I had shared a part of this story at the outset of this platform.\n              <br/>I started my Christianity as a member of FCS (Fellowship of Christian Students) in my secondary school.\n              <br/>In my first few weeks in UI I joined IVCU in 1985.It was my first fellowship.\n              <br/>One Sunday evening, in our Prefab Wooden Block in Kuti Hall where I had to squat for my first year in the University. Bro Taiwo Phillips my next door neighbor stood up as we talked one Sunday evening and announced he was going to fellowship. I wondered what other fellowship existed on campus then. I said, I would follow him.\n              <br/>I got to the fellowship, I met about twenty to thirty people (at most then). I had never, I think even till now, seen anyone beat drum sets like bro Femi Orekoya with so much energy and passion. There was no keyboard (I guess the more reason why the drumming had to be exciting),\n              <br/>It was a departure from where I was coming from ;IVCU. Yet, some thing else stood out for me that day. The warmth, exuberance and the palpable fellowship I received from the brethren.\n              <br/>All the members came to shake my hands. You can guess who they were :bros Sam, Udah-Dan,  Charles, Moses Tunji Adesemowo. Tosin Odunsi, Sisters Biodun Adegboye, Bukky nee Dipeolu, Constance, Iyabo (Duduyemi) “Moji (Bamtefa) , Sis Toyin nee Adesokan with her mouth wide disarming smile (never knew we were in same course of study at the time) and others my mind can not immediately grasp now.\n              <br/>That was the last time I went to IVCU. They responded with a vigorous follow up after but I was able to survive it.\n              <br/>SCM has continued to be the pivotal experience of my life ever since\n              <hr/>\n              Adebowale Saba</p>\n         </div>\n\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n            <img src=\"assets/img/testimonials/Dave-Fadugba.jpeg\" className=\"testimonial-img\" alt=\"\"/>\n            <h3>Rev. Dave Fadugba</h3>\n            <h4>Ogun, Nigeria</h4>\n            <p>\n            I was introduced to SCM during my HSC days at Ilesa Grammar School, Ilesa but I wasn’t really serious with it then. When I got to UI in 1985, there was a vigorous evangelism going on then. I had read in one of the novels (Pacesetters series) about October rush when you get admitted into the University, my own rush came from Bro Sam Okafor Udah. I agreed after he prayed with me and decided to join the fellowship when I eventually moved into the campus (I was coming from the town then). By the time I got a bed space to share, I landed in room D12 Indy hall. By divine providence Bro Charles Adeyanju and Bro Biodun Ogunbanwo now Oluwabamiwo were already in the room. Both were in SCM. It was the time a fellowship that broke away from SCM under the leadership of the then President was making waves in the campus. They made overtures to many Jambites then and a friend wanted me to follow him. But I got hooked to SCM from my first day in SCM. With my co-roommates it was not long before I became grounded in SCM UI.\n\n              <br/>Bible study was getting interesting, Sunday fellowship became difficult to miss. Going home during holidays was difficult for some of us because we do missed ourselves so much.\n              <br/>By the time the exco were sent off, I became exco member. I started with being the Publicity Secretary. All we do then was buying cardboard and tempo. I will on foot round the campus pasting the posters handwritten by an inexperienced Dave but with encouragement from Bro Charles who always appreciated whatever I designed. Together with aggressive evangelism, a focused and dedicated executive under Bro Tosin, numbers increased. On my part some of the brethren we knew in our HSC days were caught for SCM UI. I was virtually in all the subgroups. Drama, Halleluyah Choir, Technical unit, every job is for every available brethren then. We worked as if we were in UI for Evangelism. Never tired of heeding the call for fellowship activities even at the risk of our academic pursuit.\n              <br/>I didn’t end up with an SCMer o though they were there but with another sister who finished in another campus faraway some years after I left school. Ise Oluwa ni.\n              <br/>SCM gave me my identity. I am an SCMer (UI) through and through.\n              <br/>This is <strong>MY SCM STORY</strong>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n\n\n            </div>\n            </section>\n            </>\n        )\n    }\n}\nexport default Testimonyitems;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
