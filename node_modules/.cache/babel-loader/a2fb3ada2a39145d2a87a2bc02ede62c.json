           <p>\n                  <br/>When I joined SCM on Thursday Jan 18 (or 25, not sure) 1990, I did not even know I was joining a fellowship. I was a rather smallish boy from downtown who arrived late to resume. There was no money, so I did not make any attempt to seek accommodation.\n                  <br/>I carried a free X-Ray from home, but when I found out that I needed to pay at Jaja, I sneaked out and carried my X-Ray around. I saw that I was posted to Kuti Hall, so I went to Kuti and roamed around. I was the only student from my secondary school who got admission into UI, and I only vaguely heard that 1 of our seniors ever got admitted to UI, so I had nobody to look for.\n                  <br/>But my father always taught us that if we ever travelled away from home, we should find a temporary father where we went. The wooden block fascinated me. One old looking 100 Level student took me in (Room 29). As I roamed around, I found another old looking fresher who took interest in me. At first sight, I concluded that this should be a good school father. So, instead of staying in my Room 29, I spent most of my first 2 days in Room 40.\n                  <br/>So, on Thursday evening, my new father took his Bible and said, Let’s go. I followed him. And I just continued following him like Mumu. The whole thing was strange that day; it was so un-Baptist!\n                  <br/>And then, so many people were trying to shake my hand – kilode??!!! I still remember Bro Sola Ajibulu holding the mic that day. So I kept following my school father Sundays and Thursdays. One day, it was raining, and we hid under the Senate building.\n                  <br/>He reminded me of a popular Yoruba song, and thus recommended that we should follow Jesus into the rain. He stepped forward, and I followed him. By the time we reached Chapel, we were drenched. I followed him so much that my Dad at home knew I had another dad in school called Tade Majaro.\n                  </p>\n              </div>\n\n              <div className=\"slide\" id=\"dave-fdugba\">\n            <img src=\"assets/img/testimonials/lanipekun-lawal.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/>\n            <h3>Pastor Lawal Lanipekun</h3>\n            <h4>Lagos, Nigeria</h4>\n            <p>  <strong>MY SCM STORY…</strong>\n                <br/>I used to be known and addresed as Lawal Lanipekun-Reeves until I got married an my wife and I took the decision to drop all our non-African names and now my names are Adojutelegan Majiya Lanipekun-Lawal.My first encounter with Christianity was  as a junior High school student in December 1979. The UPN government in the South-West then had introduced the free education programme and with it came the opportunity for me to own a free Bible. It was at the invitation of a ‘crush’, that I joined the SU Movement in the school.<br/>However, I was like the proverbial seed that fell on the rock. It got withered because there was no root hold for it. I went radically back to Islam, the religion into which I was born and raised.\n                <br/>Whilst studying for my ‘A’ Levels at the Federal School of Arts and Science, Ondo (FSASON), I re-committed my heart to Jesus Christ and by November of the same year I resumed as a freshman in Sociology Department of the University of Ibadan.\n                <br/>My first time at the Chapel of the Resurrection was  November 1987. That day was the last Sunday of the joint fellowship between SCM and IVCU, as a result of the suspension of religious activities on the UI campus during Babangida era. This was in response to the counsel we were given to immediately join a Christian Fellowship preferably a CU/ Nifes immediately we resumed in our various higher institutions of learning.<br/>The Chapel that day was full and the fellowship beautiful, the worship in particular was wonderful.<br/>At the end of the service, the announcement was made for new members  to either join the  Wednesday or the Thursday Bible study group. I decided to join the Thursday group and needless to say that I was terribly disappointed when I did not see the Sunday crowd on Thursday and the music was ‘one kind’. However the fellowship was rich and people smiled genuinely. I sat besides a Sister who I later knew to be Yinka Ajomale. She prayed and worshipped as if she was listening to a different kind of music than what I was hearing.\n                <br/>Bro Charles Adeyanju preached that night and I could still picture him in my mind in his greyish-blue blazer on black trousers, I really could not remember the topic of his message ,but I could still recall  a line from his teaching “… I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren… ” I later found that quote to be from Romans… That was the impact of the message on me that night .\n                <br/>On getting to my room in E60 Zik Hall(wooden), I expressed my disappointment with regards to the attendance to one of my Christian room mates who advised that I could check out the Wednesday group. Just before I could do that, I received a visitor in the person of Brother Chika Okoroafor with whom I was upfront with my disappointment and many other questions about the fellowship. He calmly advised that I made a repeat visit on Sunday evening and when I did, the hall was still scantily filled and the music still ‘bad’, but this time around I felt I should stop complaining and instead lend myself to service in whatever ways  I could. When the call was made for people to join the choir, I registered myself with Sister Bukky Dipeolu and that night several freshers like Kolapo Oluseye, Muyiwa Ajakaiye, Ayo Ogunremi, Victor Ola-Akande, Olumide Fatokun, Agnes Bayode, Nike Adesogan, Ronke Adebayo, Sola Ajiboso, Dayo Ogunleye and many more joined. KTO who became my closest friend,  was the unofficial assistant to Sister Bukky until he later served  as the substantive leader of the Halleluyah choir.<br/>One of the days Bro Chika came visiting again and this time with Bro Sola Ajibulu who was introduced to me as the Zik Hall rep. On my first day of fellowship in his 2nd floor ‘C’ Block room, I was called on to be the Evangelism coordinator for the hall.\n                <br/>Bible studies were rich and deep, Sister Iyabo Duduyemi whom we nicknamed ‘My Radical Sister’ was my first teacher, her class was inclusive and lively. Bro Moses Olayemi as the Bible syudy secretary was a wonder with the scriptures. I looked forward to his ’rounding up’, cladded in his short sleeve shirt and pencil trousers, most times with  sandals to match.\n                <br/>I took my assignment as Zik Hall Evangelism coordinator seriously, and I intended to make a success of it. But this was cut short. One Thursday evening towards the end of first semester in my 100 levels. Bro Charles began to announce the names of the new Excos to take over from his team. I was excitedly clapping for my friends whose names were somehow desrvedly called. Tenu Adeosun(Prayer), Okikiolu Babatunde(Evangelism), Yemi Ogunrin(Tedder HR), Lekan Orenuga(Bello HR), Bolanle Olusesi, Funmi Olukoju, Allwell  Ibeagha, Biodun Adeniyi  Morgan Nwoko and some of the names earlier mentioned in the choir.  Bro Chika Okoroafor who was announced as our president was a year one Diploma student of Library studies in the Faculty of Education. It was in the midst of thede that I heard my name.There must be another Lawal Lanipekun-Reeves, I thought. When my name was announced the third time,  Bro Tenu nudged me and said ” Brother, e dide” meaning,  “wouldn’t you stand up, Brother ?”<br/>I got up with my knees knocking at each other, and sweating all over. No one consulted with me, and nothing prepared me for the shock.\n                <br/>Even though, the others were freshers like me, they had integrated so well. Majority of the science students had been involved with PSSF which Tenu Adeosun coordinated. Just Allwell,  Agnes, Biodun,  Morgan, Bro Chika and myself were in the Humanities. I believe this was the beginning of growth and stability journey of SCM, UI.<br/>It was a large Exco, and other people who served  in that team who were however not freshers include but not limited to  Brothers and Sisters  Biodun Olojo, Tope Agesin, Debo Saba, Susan Ahaemefule, Lade Ayeni, Seun Adesogan, Sola Ajibulu, Foluke (VP) and many more.<br/>My first assignment was in the Twin office of Librarian/Colprteur. Library, I understood but who or what is a “Call Porter ? ” I had never heard the word before, neither did I even know how to spell it . Eventually, I found out that a Colprteur is merchandiser of books and other materials. This ]department enhanced my growth and balanced view because apart from reading all the books in the library at the time, I had the responsibility to read materials that would be recommended for the pbrethren. In spite of the fact that the department operated without any budgetary provisions, we grew and at a time I had to  recriut Augustina Bubu,(Prof Onome Davies) to assist me.\n                <br/>My first career job, was as a salesman and merchandiser with the Leventis group. SCM gave my first cognate career experience. My other line of business now is still merchandising.\n                <br/>I later took over from Bro Sola Ajibulu and served a term as the Zik Hall Rep. It was there during this period that I met and developed solid friendship with Tope Dosumu. We were room mates with Deji and Tola Tade. The four of us are  pastors of  growing and thriving churches  today ,to the glory of God. SCM was my first seminary.<br/>My last assignment in SCM leadership was as the Publicity and Publication Unit leader.\n                <br/>I was actually called out and prayed for as the Fellowship PRO. That was how my predecessors in office,  Bro Morgan and Bro Dave Fadugba operated. I saw the weight of the assignment on them,  and I thought we should rebrand to meet the current realities and challenges of publicizing SCM at that time. We divided the assignment into two Publicity and creative writing (Publication). I had a hot headed creative,  Gbolahan Saba as a protégé. He would first fight me and everyone else before coming out with great outdoor concepts and designs. Kolade Adebayo used to call himself a ” bush boy ”  yet spoke and wrote better English than any city man I know. I used to wonder, what he was doing in Vet medicine. Tokunbo Owoseje, Fadekemi Oyewusi, Bunmi Afolayan, Bibilola Fatoki, Busola Omole, Tope Obaweya, Toyin Falode, Jabez Akindipe were some of the great people who made job easy.\n                <br/>My second career is in the Media and Marketing Communications. PPU sowed the seed of creativity into me, for which I’m forever grateful.<br/>Everywhere I looked, I see the hand of God through SCM in my life. SCM introduced me to leadership. Our exco meetings in those days were very robust and boisterous, especially when Bro Debo spoke those his English which we didn’t understand, and stubborn Deronke would  decide not to yield grounds and keep us at Chapel basement till 2:00am. Now, when church workers and ministers act ungovernable, I remember how I stressed my presidents, especially  Bros  Sola and Debo in particular.<br/>I learnt how to prayerfully plan programmes and raise money for projects.\n                <br/>There were different flavors of leadership. For Bro Chika, every meeting was deliverance, Bro Biodun almost turned all of us to Anglican priests. When Bro Sola went to Deeper Life ‘we went with him’ and all of us were saying,  “… in Jeeesus naaame… ” like Pastor Kumuyi. It was a potpourri of leadership grace and I am the better for it.\n                <br/>Our conferences and\n                <br/>mission trips to Enugu, Port-Harcourt, Benin, Ile-Ife, Jos, Ilorin etc were my first time in some of those places.<br/>I particularly enjoyed those fellowship time during holidays when only a few of us would meet and thereafter go visiting brethren in their homes. I was also visited.<br/>I remember our small parties ,love feasts a b day picnics .\n                <br/>I didn’t know how much of the word l had in me and the grace to teach it until I went for the youth service where I was made the Bible stud secretary.\n                <br/>I learnt stage crafts through my membership of the Deliverance Theater group. I wrote the play that was staged when my sister and friend, Enitan Ayansoga passed on. Yinka Fasoba had passed on a year before and we were all sad.<br/>Of all my getting from SCM, however,  I didn’t get a wife. Actually  some of my friends made serious efforts at teaching  me on how to “recieve a sister”, I guess I wasn’t spiritual enough.<br/>Well, God gave me a wonderful woman for a wife. We got married at Chapel of the Ressurection in the presence of many of my SCM family. She got the ‘ feel’ and now she’s an  SCMer by conversion. Head or tail SCM won.\n                <br/>This in a nutshell is my SCM STORY, if I have the opportunity,  I will do it again and again.\n                <br/>O God Bless our Movement SCM… !\n                <br/>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"slide\" id=\"yinka-oridupa\">\n            <img src=\"assets/img/testimonials/Oridupa.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/>\n            <h3>Dr. Yinka Oridupa</h3>\n            <h4>Ibadan, Nigeria</h4>\n            <p>\n            My SCM Story\n              <br/>I was admitted to UI in 1997 to study Vet Medicine, so I had in mind to study hard and enjoy myself being my first time away from home.\n              <br/>I come from a solid bible-believing background under the tutelage of an IVCU alumnus and most of my church folks were in IVCU. I decided to avoid IVCU but I wanted a well grounded fellowship, not some jamboree centre with delinquent teenagers. I hope I dont sound too serious because I’m really not an outwardly serious person but I believe God is serious about us.\n              <br/>A friend and I was strolling pass Chapel that Thursday night and I heard this beautiful worship (led by Mercy) which I couldn’t resist. I came in and realized it was end of fellowship, so I just sneaked out again. I was back the following Thursday and was in Bro Kadiri’s bible study class which was so in-depth and then the following week Bro Kolade. Bro Kunle Kasumu was the Gen Sec I think and he was quite inspirational.\n              <br/>My squeaking in and out continued for over a year, until one Thursday that Tomiwa caught me as I was about to sneak out as usual and invited me to join the choir. By the way, I am a worship leader and that was why I didnt want to go to IVCU. I was the music director of our youth church choir from home and I wanted to come to UI to read. I was trying to hide but I couldnt do it for too long. I joined Halleluyah choir and that was when the beauty of God’s gift made a way for me. I enjoyed all our Jabulanis, praise concerts, choir ministrations and even fellowship worship time.\n              <br/>I remember Bro Pec (Peculiar) once told me he used to record any worship session I led for his personal worship time. SCM gave me a bigger avenue to touch heaven with my worship. I have literarily seen heaven open during worship before. Worship still remains an integral part of my life, I live to worship God and lead people to God’s presence. Serving in the exco as SEFLO is another part and this opened up the world of alumni to me. I had to relate with very old people and even people that met me in school and left because I was in UI for 6years.\n              <br/>I remember asking them if they were sure God told them I was to be in the exco because I knew I would radicalize the norm. I didnt believe in those long exco meetings, calling Bro and Sista this and that but disrespectful, among other unduly sanctimonious norms. I remember a family meeting where I said if calling me Sister, then a 600L student and exco member, was going to hinder our friendship drop the sister and call me my name. I was more interested in having Godly and truthful friends. SCM has blessed me with friends, family and especially a Godly mentor and father, Prof Saba.\n              <br/>This is my SCM story.\n            </p>\n         </div>\n\n         <div className=\"slide\" id=\"kuforiji-gbenga\">\n            <img src=\"assets/img/testimonials/kuforiji.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/>\n            <h3>Dr. Kuforiji Gbenga</h3>\n            <h4>Ibadan, Nigeria</h4>\n            <p>\n            My SCM Story\n              <br/>I gained admission to UI to study Veterinary Medicine in the year 1990. I came from a church background which encouraged me to join a Bible believing fellowship as soon as I got to school.\n              <br/>I stayed in Independence hall room A1 in my first year. I was invited to SCM one Thursday evening by Bro Soji Ademuyiwa who also was in 100L with me at the time. He was visiting his course mate who happened to be my ‘landlord’ at the time. My ‘landlord’ was already attached to a Fellowship: that was my first week in UI. I moved to campus a bit later than my mates. I recall being visited by Sis Tundun.\n              <br/>In my 200L, I was appointed Mellamby Hall repwhen I took over from Bro Tunji Shobayo. It was a great time to grow spiritually walking and working with the brethren. We had many sessions of fasting and retreats at ICS in which there was no food, no water: only air. That was the slogan.\n              <br/>I remember I was an SCM Usher most of my stay in UI. I served with many AGS’s: Sis Toyin Omope, Sis Tope Obaweya, Sis Bola Morohundiya, Sis Adeola (now Obasa)… can’t recall any other. I was usually situated in the central isle of the chapel.\n              <br/>Was also involved in Follow up group: I loved visiting and I still do. I still wonder why I never got involved with school visitation.\n              <br/>In my final year, I got into a relationship with Miss Iyabo Abiri, a fellow SCMer, Veterinary student and a fellow SCM Usher….\n              <br/>As they say, the rest is history\n              </p>\n         </div>\n\n         <div className=\"slide\" id=\"omolayo-ipinmoye\">\n            <img src=\"assets/img/testimonials/ipinmoye.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n            <h3>Omolayo Ipinmoye</h3>\n            <h4>Ibadan, Nigeria</h4>\n            <p>\n            My SCM Story\n            <br/>Good day beloved,  the story of my Christian journey is incomplete  without SCM UI where the seed of my salvation was watered, nourished and ever since has been growing. My encounter with the fellowship  started around this time 29 yrs ago when I got admission to UI. At the admission office area some brethren gave me a  handbill (not printed but hand written ) inviting me for a fellowship, some days later, on getting to my allocated room in idia hall, I was welcomed by a lovely Sister full of smiles in person of sis Tundun Ogunbanwo nee Fasina. She was very nice,  she was just like a big sister always ready to give a helping hand,  so automatically, when she invited me for a fellowship I couldn’t say no & when I asked her the name of the fellowship lo & behold it was the same with the handbill scm.\n            <br/>The fellowship was full of life; it was as if all the brethren were taught how to smile and welcome people. Though they were not much, no musical instrument but you could feel the love,  feel at home with the brethren & also feel the presence of God. SCM UI was home away from home.\n            <br/>How i loved to join the choir then but i have a very wonderful voice, knowing  that if i sing the whole fellowship will fall under the anointing of laughter. Hmm, drawing i can’t draw, so I ‘jejely’ joined the prayer band. Thank God I did, it wasn’t a mistake.\n            <br/>Many wonderful memories;  is it the 3 days retreat no water, no food during moG leadership…. I thought I would pass out, sisters’ programs, weddings outside Ibadan, genuine  display of love, exposition of the word( which really helped me to have a foundation that am building on today) and many more beautiful time i had in scm ui.\n            <br/>Married to a scmer?\n            <br/>No. God bless our movement SCM…..\n            <br/>Omolayo Ipinmoye nee Omope\n              </p>\n         </div>\n\n         <div className=\"slide\" id=\"dave-fdugba\">\n            <img src=\"assets/img/testimonials/Dave-Fadugba.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/>\n            <h3>Rev. Dave Fadugba</h3>\n            <h4>Ogun, Nigeria</h4>\n            <p>\n              I was introduced to SCM during my HSC days at Ilesa Grammar School, Ilesa but I wasn’t really serious with it then. When I got to UI in 1985, there was a vigorous evangelism going on then. I had read in one of the novels (Pacesetters series) about October rush when you get admitted into the University, my own rush came from Bro Sam Okafor Udah. I agreed after he prayed with me and decided to join the fellowship when I eventually moved into the campus (I was coming from the town then). By the time I got a bed space to share, I landed in room D12 Indy hall. By divine providence Bro Charles Adeyanju and Bro Biodun Ogunbanwo now Oluwabamiwo were already in the room. Both were in SCM. It was the time a fellowship that broke away from SCM under the leadership of the then President was making waves in the campus. They made overtures to many Jambites then and a friend wanted me to follow him. But I got hooked to SCM from my first day in SCM. With my co-roommates it was not long before I became grounded in SCM UI.\n              <br/>Bible study was getting interesting, Sunday fellowship became difficult to miss. Going home during holidays was difficult for some of us because we do missed ourselves so much.\n              <br/>By the time the exco were sent off, I became exco member. I started with being the Publicity Secretary. All we do then was buying cardboard and tempo. I will on foot round the campus pasting the posters handwritten by an inexperienced Dave but with encouragement from Bro Charles who always appreciated whatever I designed. Together with aggressive evangelism, a focused and dedicated executive under Bro Tosin, numbers increased. On my part some of the brethren we knew in our HSC days were caught for SCM UI. I was virtually in all the subgroups. Drama, Halleluyah Choir, Technical unit, every job is for every available brethren then. We worked as if we were in UI for Evangelism. Never tired of heeding the call for fellowship activities even at the risk of our academic pursuit.\n              <br/>I didn’t end up with an SCMer o though they were there but with another sister who finished in another campus faraway some years after I left school. Ise Oluwa ni.\n              <br/>SCM gave me my identity. I am an SCMer (UI) through and through.\n              <br/>This is <strong>MY SCM STORY</strong>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n\n          <div className=\"slide\" id=\"prof-saba\">\n            <img src=\"assets/img/testimonials/prof-saba.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/>\n            <h3>Prof A.

Bro Taiwo Phillips my next door neighbor stood up as we talked one Sunday evening and announced he was going to fellowship. I wondered what other fellowship existed on campus then. I said, I would follow him.\n              <br/>I got to the fellowship, I met about twenty to thirty people (at most then). I had never, I think even till now, seen anyone beat drum sets like bro Femi Orekoya with so much energy and passion. There was no keyboard (I guess the more reason why the drumming had to be exciting),\n              <br/>It was a departure from where I was coming from ;IVCU. Yet, some thing else stood out for me that day. The warmth, exuberance and the palpable fellowship I received from the brethren.\n              <br/>All the members came to shake my hands. You can guess who they were :bros Sam, Udah-Dan,  Charles, Moses Tunji Adesemowo. Tosin Odunsi, Sisters Biodun Adegboye, Bukky nee Dipeolu, Constance, Iyabo (Duduyemi) “Moji (Bamtefa) , Sis Toyin nee Adesokan with her mouth wide disarming smile (never knew we were in same course of study at the time) and others my mind can not immediately grasp now.\n              <br/>That was the last time I went to IVCU. They responded with a vigorous follow up after but I was able to survive it.\n              <br/>SCM has continued to be the pivotal experience of my life ever since\n              <br/>\n              Adebowale Saba</p>\n         </div>\n\n\n\n\n            </div>\n            </div>\n            </section>\n            </>\n        )\n    }\n}\nexport default Testimonyitems;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
